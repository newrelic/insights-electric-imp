## New Relic Insights Electric Imp Library

Use this library to easily post custom events to New Relic Insights.  It should work on all Electric Imp OS versions and hardware.

## Usage
Simply merge the code from agent.nut into your Agent and ensure your account number and API key is set.  Then from your device code, it's possible to do the following:

    // Construct an event...
    local event = {
        eventType = "ExampleEvent", // Required
        platform  = "ElectricImp",
        cats      = 100,
    };
    
    // And send it!
    agent.send("insights", event);

See device.nut for a more complete example on how to use this library.
